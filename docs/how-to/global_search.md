# Using Global Search

Open Chat Studio has a global search feature that allows you to find objects using their public UUIDs. This is useful when you want to quickly find an object without navigating through the UI, especially if you have copied the UUID from a trace or another source.

To use the global search feature, navigate to `https://chatbots.dimagi.com/search?q=UUID` where `UUID` is the public UUID of the object you want to find.

If the object is found, and you have permissions to access it, you will be redirected to the page for that object.
