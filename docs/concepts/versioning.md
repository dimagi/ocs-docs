# Versioning

Versioning is now enabled by default for all projects on Open Chat Studio. This comes with a few important changes that modify the default behavior of the platform.

## Terms
OCS uses the following terms:

* *Unreleased Version*. This is the version of the chatbot that exists when you click the edit button on the experiment. It can also be considered a "draft" or that it has "unsaved changes".

* *Published Version*. This is the version that users will interact with through the web, WhatsApp or any other configured channel--including the public link.

!!! info "A note version functionality"
    Once a version is made, it cannot be edited or modified. This ensures that the users' experience remains stable even if the authors may be changing the unrealeased version.


!!! warning "Chatting to the unreleased version"

    To chat to the unreleased version, navigate to the Experiment home page and click on the speech bubble icon at the top right corner of the page. There, a drop down will say either "Unreleased Version" or "Published Version". Select the Unreleased Version, and that will open a web chat. Only bot authors can chat with the unreleased version as it is not available through channels.This is a change in the default behavior of the platform as prior to versioning, all channels chatted to the unreleased version at all times.

#### Changing the Published Version
The published version can be selected from any released version of the experiment. To modify which version is the published version:

- Select "View Details" of the version
- Press the "Set as Published Version" button at the button of the dialog box.

Alternatively, when a new version is being created, it can be set as the published version by marking the checkbox "Set as Published Version".

Only one version can be the published version at a time.
