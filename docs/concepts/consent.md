# Understanding Consent Forms

Consent forms allow chatbot makers to provide context to chatbot users on how their data will be used, and who to contact about any
concerns.

    If you are deploying your chatbot on WhatsApp, Telegram or any channels other than the Web channel, you can still incorporate consent forms in your chatbot by enabling the "Conversational Consent" option for the chatbot.

A default consent form is created for each team. You can customize this default form or create new forms by navigating to the "Consent Forms" section of the platform.

## What to put in a consent form

Some common elements you may want to include in a consent form are:

* That you do not guarantee the accuracy of chatbot responses.
* How you might use data from chatbot interactions.
* An email address and phone number for the relevant team running the chatbot.
* A set of bullets asking the user to confirm that they have read the context above, that they are over 18 years of age and that they have voluntarily agreed to try out the chatbot.
