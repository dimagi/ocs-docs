# Understanding Consent Forms

Consent forms allow chatbot makers to provide context to chatbot users on how their data will be used, and who to contact regarding any concerns. Consent forms are displayed to users before they start interacting with the chatbot.

    If you are deploying your chatbot on WhatsApp, Telegram or any channels other than the Web channel, you can still include consent forms in your chatbot by enabling the 'Conversational Consent' option for the chatbot.

A default consent form is created for each team. You can customize this default form or create new forms by navigating to the "Consent Forms" section of the platform.

## What to put in a consent form

Some common elements you may want to include in a consent form are:

* A disclaimer stating that the accuracy of chatbot responses is not guaranteed.
* How you might use data from chatbot interactions.
* An email address and phone number for the relevant team responsible for managing the chatbot.
