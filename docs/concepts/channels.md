# Channels

To enable users to interact with your bot through external social media platforms and similar services, OCS integrates with various [messaging providers][1]. This integration allows you to deploy your bot to external platforms. Once a platform is linked to your bot, users can communicate with it through that platform. In OCS, the term "channel" is synonymous with "platform."

### Current supported channels are
- Telegram
- Whatsapp
- Facebook Messenger
- SureAdhere
- Slack
- API

!!! info "The web channel"
    Although the web channel is not an external platform, it is still considered a channel through which users can interact with your bot.
