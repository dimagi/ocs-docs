# Overview

Dimagi is developing Open Chat Studio (OCS) as an easy-to-use, open source platform for rapidly prototyping and testing
chatbots created using Large Language Models (LLMs). Open Chat Studio makes it easy to develop and test LLM-based
chatbots, and to instill a variety of guardrails to improve the safety and accuracy of these bots. Open Chat Studio can
work with any LLM with an API such as the GPT-4 API.

# What is a Large Language Model?

A Large Language Model is a type of artificial intelligence software that is trained on a vast amount of text data. Its
primary function is to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This training allows it to produce text-based
responses, answer questions, translate between languages, and perform various other language-related tasks. The term "
large" in its name refers to the extensive volume of data it has been trained on and the complexity of its design,
enabling it to handle complex language tasks.

(The definition above was authored by the famous LLM that powers ChatGPT: GPT-4 developed by OpenAI).
