# About Open Chat Studio

[Dimagi](https://dimagi.com/) is developing Open Chat Studio (OCS) as an easy-to-use, open source platform for rapidly prototyping and testing chatbots created using Large Language Models (LLMs). Open Chat Studio makes it easy to develop and test LLM-based chatbots, and to instill a variety of guardrails to improve the safety and accuracy of these bots.

Open Chat Studio can work with any LLM with an API such as the [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation).
