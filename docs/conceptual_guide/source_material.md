Source Material is a feature that allows you to provide specific content, information, or data which the chatbot can use as a reference or knowledge base. This is particularly useful for LLM-based chatbots, as it helps tailor the chatbotâ€™s responses to be more aligned with your specific needs or the theme of the chatbot.

#### How to use source material
- Content Integration: You can integrate specific documents or text into the chatbot. This could be information on a given health area in an FAQs format, program-specific data, or any other relevant content that you want your chatbot to reference. 

- Contextual Relevance: By providing this material, you're essentially giving the chatbot a more focused and relevant context to operate within. This means your chatbot can provide more accurate and tailored responses based on the Source Materials you've provided.

- Updating Information: Keep your Source Materials up-to-date. As you update program materials (for example guidelines for counselling or home visits), updating your Source Materials will help ensure your chatbot remains relevant and effective. 

#### Best Practices
- Relevance and Accuracy: Ensure the materials are relevant to the conversations your chatbot will engage in. 

- Organization and Structure: Well-organized Source Materials make it easier for the chatbot to retrieve and use the information. It's useful to structure your content in a clear, concise manner, with appropriate labels for different sections.
